# Crowd Simulation Thesis

This repository contains materials related to my bachelor thesis *Crowd Simulation*. It includes the thesis PDF, the defense poster PDF, and links to example simulation videos. The project presents a mathematically grounded model for terrain traversal based on slope and heading costs, its discretization, and application to crowd simulation.
